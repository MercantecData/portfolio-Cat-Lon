                <h1>Welcome to the front page of The Wiki!</h1>
                <p>I decided to make this page for my final project to practice my clientside programming skill. But also because i thought it could be fun, as a way to practice my Javascript programming. I made every subsite a template so they would automatically generate after being set up. not entirely though, you do need to paste a very small amount of HTML just to set up the page itself and letting javascript do the rest</p>
                <h2><a href="index.html">Lorem ipsum</a></h2>
                <p>the intended use of Lorem Ipsum is to test font types sizes kerning and the like, in reality it doesn't even mean anything. it's just butchered latin.</p>
                <h2>Bacon ipsum</h2>
                <p>Sort of the same thing as Lorem Ipsum except it's all <a href="index3.html">meat</a></p>
